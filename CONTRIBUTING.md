# Contributing

Include one unique `.changelog/*.md` fragment for each observable change. Use
PHP 8.5+ and [CPX](https://github.com/laravel/cpx) to run the isolated tooling;
the library itself does not gain a runtime dependency:

```sh
cpx --skip-local fast-forward/changelog add "Describe the change." --category=fixed --type=patch --no-interaction
cpx --skip-local fast-forward/changelog check --no-interaction
# Compare committed changes with the contribution base:
cpx --skip-local fast-forward/changelog check --since=origin/main --no-interaction
```

Select the category and semantic impact that describe the change. Keep published
history intact; pending notes belong in fragments rather than an `Unreleased`
section.

Run `composer install` to restore the project skill into
`.agents/skills/fast-forward-changelog` through the development-only `llm/skills`
plugin and the reviewed GitHub source in `skills.json`. Generated skill files
are ignored by Git. Use `composer skills:show` to inspect the source and
`composer skills:update --from=github` for an explicit refresh within its
configured version range. Review `skills.json` before changing that range.

The [workflow](.github/workflows/changelog.yml) follows the maintainer-selected
`v0` release channel. It validates PR notes, maintains PR feedback and prepares
one version PR on `changelog/version`. The skill's configured GitHub version
range is managed independently of the moving workflow channel.
Review that PR's version, history and consumed fragments before merging.
After that approved version PR is merged into `main`, automatic publication
creates its version tag and GitHub Release. The workflow never merges PRs.

The existing `1.0.0` history was backfilled from its GitHub Release, preserving
the published description. Future historical imports use the same GitHub source.
Release bodies that contain only comparison links still need editorial review;
no PR attribution is inferred from prose alone. New release preparation resolves
fragment origins through GitHub and adds proven PR links automatically.
